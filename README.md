# Strategia
This is an implementation of Unity DOTS in a strategy game.
It was done as a final school project. And as I have already graduated, I'm releasing the source code.
There isn't much gameplay as the purpose of this project was to implement DOTS, so this project is more just an example of DOTS.
<br />
<br />Made with Unity 2021.2.7f1 and Entities package 0.17.0-preview.42
<br />
<br />A lot of things has changed in version 1.0 of Entities package, so I recommend reading both:
